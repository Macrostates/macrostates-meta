# Annex: package integrity locks

Read when importing archive packages, verifying external packages or inspecting
a provenance baseline. The CLI is recommended but optional; manual imports and
verification must preserve the same evidence.

## Location and ownership

Track `.macrostates/specs/composition.lock.yaml` alongside the composition and
package contents. The composition selects release tags; the lock records what
was resolved and verified. It does not define authority, select another version
or permit `source.commit` in the composition. Local packages remain editable and
are excluded from external integrity inventories.

## Format 1

Top-level `schema_version` is the integer `1`. `packages` is a mapping keyed by
each imported external package name. Each record contains:

- `selection`: selected `name`, `version`, normalized relative `path` (without
  trailing slash), `entrypoint` and complete credential-free `source`.
- `commit`: the tag's resolved full lowercase Git commit ID (40 or 64 hex digits).
- `files`: every package-relative file path mapped to its lowercase SHA-256
  `sha256` and boolean `executable` flag.
- `content_sha256`: SHA-256 of UTF-8 canonical JSON serialization of `files`,
  recursively sorted keys, separators `,` and `:`, no whitespace, and non-ASCII
  characters retained (`ensure_ascii=False`).

Inventory ordinary files, including dot files; exclude only the archive's
outer directory and Git checkout metadata. Empty directories have no record.
Any execute bit makes `executable` true. Compare extracted bytes, not compressed
archive bytes. Reject absolute paths, traversal, links, special files, unsafe
Git metadata paths, overlapping destinations and case collisions.

## Establishing and checking a baseline

Resolve the selected tag at its canonical repository, verify tagged metadata,
entrypoints and dependencies, and calculate inventory before importing. A manual
lock must match the canonical release; never bless unexplained local changes.
Record the verification method in workflow evidence.

Offline verification checks selection binding and the full inventory, including
missing, added, modified and mode-changed files. A clean Git working tree is
insufficient. Locks are reviewed evidence, not signatures or independent proof
of upstream trust; review lock changes as carefully as package changes.

For unchanged selections, later source access must refuse moved tags or changed
content at a recorded commit. Stop and investigate. Deliberate updates change
version/tag together, verify the new release, require installed files to match
the old baseline, and replace content and lock coherently. Preserve unexplained
local modifications. Interrupted operations must leave recoverable evidence;
never discard it merely to rerun an installer.

Subtree projects may record locks after canonical comparison; locks never
establish or replace subtree history. Unknown formats require an explicit reader
or equivalent documented verification; never guess.
