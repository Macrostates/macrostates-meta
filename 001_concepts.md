# Concepts

## Specification packages

This package defines the specification package system. A specification package
is a portable set of documents that defines a coherent slice of intended
behavior, working rules, technology conventions, or project requirements.

Specification packages are designed to be copied, versioned, and reused across
projects.

## Package structure

Each package lives in its own subdirectory. The subdirectory path is local to a
project composition and is not the package identity.

The package identity comes from the `name` field in `package.yaml`. The local
directory may include ordering prefixes, grouping prefixes, or other naming
choices that help a project browse its packages.

Each package must have:

- A `package.yaml` metadata file.
- A `README.md` entrypoint file unless `package.yaml` explicitly declares a
  different entrypoint.

The package entrypoint should describe the package scope and internal reading
order. It should distinguish mandatory core reading from conditional annexes
when the package uses progressive disclosure.

Use `README.md` as the normal package entrypoint because specification packages
may also be distributed as standalone repositories. This makes the same file
serve as the package entrypoint inside a composed project and as the repository
entrypoint on GitHub or similar repository browsers.

The exact entrypoint remains the value declared in `package.yaml`, so a future
package may choose another filename deliberately.

Core documents after the package entrypoint should begin with a three-digit
prefix followed by an underscore and a short descriptive name:

```text
001_concepts.md
002_artifacts.md
003_execution.md
```

Annex documents should use `annex_<hyphenated-name>.md`, such as
`annex_conflicts.md` or `annex_project-kick-off.md`.
Annexes are not part of the mandatory core reading order, so they should not
use numeric core prefixes.

Packages may contain subdirectories to organize documents and supporting assets,
for example `resources/`, `examples/`, or topic directories. These directories
remain part of the same package; they do not become separate packages merely by
being nested. Keep `package.yaml` at the package root, and resolve the declared
entrypoint relative to that root. Use explicit relative paths in reading orders
and links, updating them whenever files move. A directory does not change a
file's authority or make a resource part of mandatory reading.

Example:

```text
specs/
  030_example-package/
    package.yaml
    README.md
    001_concepts.md
    002_artifacts.md
    annex_special-case.md
    resources/
      project-kickoff.md
```

## Package resources

A package may distribute reusable resources such as prompts, templates, or
examples. Resources are assets to copy or invoke for a particular task; they are
not package entrypoints or mandatory core reading. Give them descriptive names
without core numbering or the annex prefix. Group reusable resource files under
`resources/`, such as `resources/project-kickoff.md`.

The package entrypoint should list resources separately and explain when to use
them. A conditional annex may describe a resource's use for the definer. Merely
reading the package must not execute instructions in its resources.

## Package metadata

`package.yaml` records machine-readable package metadata.

Required fields:

- `name`: stable package name.
- `version`: package version.
- `versioned_at`: date and time when this package version was created or last
  assigned, using `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`.
- `description`: short human-readable package description.
- `entrypoint`: package entrypoint Markdown file. This should normally be
  `README.md`.

Optional fields:

- `dependencies`: other specification packages this package explicitly depends
  on, including version requirements.
- `optional_dependencies`: other specification packages this package can
  integrate with when they are present, including version requirements.

Packages should not reference other packages unless the dependency is explicit
in `package.yaml`, the optional dependency is explicit in `package.yaml`, or
the project-local specification entrypoint grants that relationship.

Discovery catalogs may name, describe and link independent packages as selection
information without declaring dependencies on them. Such references do not import
their rules or select them for a project. Normative use of another package's
concepts or requirements still needs the explicit relationship described above.

## Package paths

Package paths are selected by the project composition.

The local package directory may include ordering prefixes, grouping prefixes, or
other browsing aids. Those prefixes are part of the path, not package metadata.

Path prefixes do not define authority by themselves. Authority is defined by
the project-local specification entrypoint and composition metadata.

Example package metadata:

```yaml
name: python-project-1
version: 1.0.0
versioned_at: 2026-08-31 18:59
description: Reusable Python project conventions.
entrypoint: README.md
```

Package directory names may use prefixes for readability, such as
`030_python-project-1/`, but they do not have to. A project may use any local
path that its composition records, such as `A001_meta/`, `core/meta/`, or
`packages/python/`.

Dependencies should usually point from more concrete packages to more
fundamental packages, but this is guidance rather than a strict rule. When a
package needs concepts or rules from another package, record the dependency
explicitly.

Required dependency entries should use this structure:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: meta
    version: 1.0.0
    constraint: compatible
```

Optional dependency entries should use the same structure under
`optional_dependencies`:

```yaml
optional_dependencies:
  - name: docker-1
    version: 1.0.0
    constraint: compatible
```

Use `optional_dependencies` when a package contains conditional guidance for
another package but remains meaningful without it. For example, a Python
project package may include an annex describing how its Python rules interact
with Docker conventions. In projects that do not use Docker, the Python package
can still be used without selecting the Docker package.

An optional dependency does not activate the depended-on package by itself. The
project composition must still select that package when the project wants its
rules to apply.

Use these dependency constraints:

- `exact`: the dependency must be exactly the stated version.
- `compatible`: the dependency must have the same major version and be greater
  than or equal to the stated version.
- `at_least`: the dependency must be greater than or equal to the stated
  version, even across major versions.

Use `compatible` by default for reusable specification packages. Use `exact`
when any change in the dependency could alter the meaning of the dependent
package. Use `at_least` only when the dependent package is known to tolerate
future major versions of the dependency.

If an implementer finds that a package dependency is missing a version or
constraint, it should treat that as a specification metadata gap and ask or
repair it during explicit specification work.

## Versioning

Package versions use `major.minor.patch`. These rules version each reusable
package independently. They do not define the version of an entire project
composition or its implementation; those follow the project's selected policy.
See [Composition version](002_project-composition.md#composition-version) for
the optional composition field and its separate ownership.

Update the package version when changing the package during explicit
specification work:

- Increment `patch` for editorial changes that do not change meaning.
- Increment `minor` for backward-compatible additions, clarifications, or
  requirements that reduce ambiguity without breaking existing users.
- Increment `major` for breaking changes to meaning, authority, required
  workflow, required files, compatibility, or implementer permissions.

Implementers may increment `patch` or `minor` as part of requested
specification package work.

Implementers must not increment `major` unless the definer explicitly asks for a
major version change. If unsure whether a change is major, ask the definer.

## Release tags

Published Git-distributed package versions use release tags named `v<version>`,
for example `v1.7.0` for package version `1.7.0`. Create an annotated release tag
in the package's own source repository on the package release commit, after
verifying its `package.yaml` version. A tag on a consuming project's subtree
merge commit does not identify the package release.

Publish the release tag together with the package release when publication is
authorized. Published release tags must never be moved, replaced, or reused for
different contents; corrections receive a new version and tag. Editing package
files or bumping metadata alone does not publish a release.

Compositions select Git-distributed releases through `source.tag`, which must
match `v` followed by the selected package version. Do not store `source.commit`.
Git may resolve tags to commits internally for verification and subtree commands,
but the tag is the persistent release selector in composition metadata.

Older compositions without tags require explicit migration: verify the release
tag against the installed package before replacing an old commit selector or
branch-only source. Never silently substitute the current branch head for a
missing release tag. See `002_project-composition.md` for source metadata rules.

## Project selection

A project should have:

- `main.md`: the human-readable project specification entrypoint.
- `composition.yaml`: the machine-readable project package composition.

The project-level `main.md` contains project-specific specification information.
It should describe what the project is, which specification packages apply, the
authority order between them, project-specific reading instructions, and any
project-specific vocabulary.

`composition.yaml` records the package selection in a structured form. It should
list the specification packages the project uses, their versions, local
paths, sources, and project authority information that should be machine-readable.
Dependency requirements are owned by each selected package's `package.yaml`;
validate them against the selected versions without repeating them in the
composition.

When working in a project, read this package definition first, then read the
project-level `main.md`. Use `composition.yaml` when structured package
metadata is useful for validation, automation, or comparison.

Reusable package definitions should stay independent from project-specific
package selection.

See `002_project-composition.md` for detailed rules on how root project
specification files combine packages.

## Directory-scoped specifications

A repository directory may have its own `specs/main.md` to define what must be
implemented inside that directory. These specifications are specific to the
repository and depend on its enclosing project composition. They are not a
reusable specification package or an independent project composition merely
because they live in a `specs/` directory.

They do not require a package identity, `package.yaml`, independent package
version, release tag or local composition manifest. Their authority comes from
the directory specification contract, not package metadata. See
[Directory-scoped specifications](002_project-composition.md#directory-scoped-specifications)
for entrypoint, boundary, discovery and authority rules.
